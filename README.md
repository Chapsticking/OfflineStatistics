# Control Chart Analyzer

All calculations run locally on your machine. Nothing gets sent over the internet.
Itâ€™s built entirely in vanilla JavaScript. No LLMs were used, as you can probably tell lol.

I made this as a personal project to improve my vanilla JS skills and get a better feel for how different frameworks work.

This tool was originally built for the 2R2 community after visiting a few bases where people were struggling with the basics of control charts. The goal was to make those concepts easier to understand.

If you're curious how it works, take a look at home.js. The only external library I used was Chart.js because coding a line graph from scratch sounded like a nightmare.

Everything is bundled into the project and runs completely offline.
